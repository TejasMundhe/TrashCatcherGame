# Trash Catcher Game
## Inspiration
I was inspired to build this game by my own experiences of being overwhelmed by the goliath problem that is ocean pollution. I wanted to make a fun, interactive game that inspires the next generation to create a solution to safe our oceans.

## What it does
This multiplayer game allows two players to compete to collect the most trash in their recycling bins before it reaches the ocean. Points are received for collecting trash, and the players statistics such as how many pounds of trash they collected are displayed when the reset button is pressed to finish the game. Reload to reset all players as well as points.

## How I built it
I built this game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the help of the p5.js library to simplify game development. To make it multiplayer I used a firebase real time database to save players positions, points, and names. Finally I used GitHub for version control and the pages feature to host the game.

## Challenges I ran into
I had to adapt the image sizes to fit the screen and be proportional to the other images, and utilize GitHub pages to host the game since my local host wasn't working.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Making a fully functional game in just 24 hours that raises awareness towards climate change, and using a firebase real time database to make the game multiplayer.

## What I learned
Database creation, implementation, and management skills as well as library implementation and GitHub version control and pages implementation.

## What's next for the Trash-Catcher Game
Continue development to add additional game modes such as tower defense, add single player, and continuing interface development. Next finalize the game for launch as a website and app with updates as needed for our growing user base.
